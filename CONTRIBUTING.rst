Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

suxarray could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official suxarray docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

We use ``Sphinx``  for documentatation with reStructuredText format. The documentation is in the ``docs`` directory.

We follow ``numpydoc`` style for docstrings. You can find the details at https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/cadwrdeltamodeling/suxarray/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)
